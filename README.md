# File Organizer

This project helps you organize files in a directory by sorting them into folders based on their file types. It can also archive older files if configured to do so.

- **Categorization**: Automatically moves files into folders based on extensions.

- **Auto-Archiving**: Moves files older than X days to an Archive folder.

- **Collision Prevention**: Automatically renames files if a duplicate exists in the destination.

- **Configuration**: No code changes needed—just edit config.json.
